# password-generator

## Description

The reason behind making this project was to create a website that can automatically generated passwords.

I built this project to be able to randomly generate passwords with 8-128 characters, also including capital and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.

It solves the problem of users struggling to think of passwords, when they can just come ton this website, answer the criteria correctly and generate a random password to their liking.

I learnt a lot creating this website, it helped improve my JavaScript skills immensely and taught me different features of JavaScript to use in the future ahead.
